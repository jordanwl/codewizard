# Code Wizard

A Rails app designed to gamify flash cards.

## Motivation
After experiencing how boring and dull simple multiple-choice quizzes and flash cards are, Code Wizard was created as an attempt to make learning the basics of Ruby more interesting and engaging.

## Features
- Fully animated

- Fully functional combat system

- Fully functional item and inventory system

- Working Leaderboard and points system

## Credits
Code Wizard was originally made in collaboration with [JT Weng](https://github.com/wengair/) and [Yuji Masuda](https://github.com/yujimsd) over a period of 9 days as part of our final project at [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com/).

This fork represents my continuing work on Code Wizard as a personal project in order to improve my Ruby on Rails and HTML/CSS/Javascript ability.
